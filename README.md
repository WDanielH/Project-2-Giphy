# Project-2-Giphy
TAMUK Quickstart Bootcamp Project Two -- Gif Search

By Warren Hardell

This project is a simple implementation of the GIPHY API to build a gif search engine. The user supplies a search phrase and quanity and the website queries the GIPHY api for gifs matching the search phrase and then returns the specified quantity of gifs.

The site displays in three columns on desktop displays and imn a single column on mobile displays

The nav bar displays differently on each display and there is a "hamburger" button in mobile views to toggle the display

This project used HTML CSS / Sass, Javascript and Jquery as well as the GIPHY API

I decided to make the styling based on STAR TREK both as added entertainment for me while I worked and to practice matching styling. Special thanks to Aaron Barker for his code pen which got me started with they styling. (https://codepen.io/beanfarmer/pen/vOajmM)

TO IMPLEMENT
Site-wide
6) Choose a Google Font that you've never heard of before and use that to style your site title

â€¢ Ideas for future improvement (minimum of 3)
I am pretty happy with the funcationality of this site but some things I would do to improve the project
- include some feedback to the user if they do not have any gifs returned. Currently a nonsense phrase doesnt return any gifs and could confuse a user
- additional themeing to make the site look more Star Trek would be fun 
- the vertical stacking nav bar in mobile view is very basic, id like to implement a slicker looking navbar 
- adding animation to the hamburger button would also be nice
