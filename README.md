I decided to make the styling based on STAR TREK both as added entertainment for me while I worked and to practice matching styling. Special thanks to Aaron Barker for his code pen which got me started with they styling. (https://codepen.io/beanfarmer/pen/vOajmM)


TO IMPLEMENT
Site-wide
6) Choose a Google Font that you've never heard of before and use that to style your site title
Here is a helpful video!

Mobile (320px and below)
Use a @media query to ensure that :
10) Your site title and navbar stack vertically
11) Your navigation items stack vertically
12) Your images stack vertically in a single column

I think I need to append divs to the colums and then append images to the divs. set a fixed size for the div and set the image to scale inside it.
