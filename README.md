GIPHY API
Flexible Grids for Desktop and mobile use


I decided to make the styling based on STAR TREK both as added entertainment for me while I worked and to practice matching styling. Special thanks to Aaron Barker for his code pen which got me started with they styling. (https://codepen.io/beanfarmer/pen/vOajmM)


TO IMPLEMENT
Site-wide
6) Choose a Google Font that you've never heard of before and use that to style your site title
Here is a helpful video!

Mobile (320px and below)
10) Your site title and navbar stack vertically
11) Your navigation items stack vertically

*** Items I'd like to implement ***
1) My solution to append the powered by giphy logo doenst look great in mobile. (I append a row of empty divs to the grid and place the giphy logo in the right col. In mobile view tis results in two blank squares in the middle of the results rather than the top). I believe I could fix this with using the same @media check to prevent the appending
